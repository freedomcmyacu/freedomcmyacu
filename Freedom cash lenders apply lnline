 If your postdated check fails to clear the bank and you do not make other arrangements to pay by your due date, the lender rolls your loan into a subsequent two-week term.4 The lender will also tack on another finance charge and typically assesses an additional late fee or penalty. In short order, you could be on the hook for several multiples of your original loan amount.

Many payday lenders prey on low-income earners and those desperate for cash, and their businesses are often located in higher-crime areas, although not always.

You can circumvent the need to go to a physical location by seeking a lender online, but doing so subjects you to another set of risks. Some websites offering payday loans are nothing more than scams to extract sensitive personal information.
