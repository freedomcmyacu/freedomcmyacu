Asking which one is better to get—title loans or payday loans—is equivalent to asking which illness is better to get during the winter. Both loan products feature unreasonably high interest rates, unfavorable terms, and potentially aggressive collection tactics. The two significant differences between a title loan and a payday loan are how you can borrow and the interest rates on each loan.

Title loans typically offer lower interest rates—for example, a 300% annual percentage rate (APR) versus 400% for payday loans—but also impose harsher penalties for nonpayment, as the lender can take ownership of your vehicle.
