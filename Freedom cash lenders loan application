Freedom cash lenders loan application

Payday lenders offer short-term cash loans in exchange for a postdated check, usually dated for your next payday. The amount of the check includes the loan total and a finance charge. For example, you write a check for $115 to receive a $100 loan. Given a two-week loan term, which is relatively standard, the $15 finance charge works out to an APR of nearly 400%, and this assumes you pay back the loan on time.
